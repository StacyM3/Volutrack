## 🚀 Overview
**Volutrack** is an AI-enhanced tool that helps shippers quickly estimate **volumetric weight** from package photos or live video, calculate **shipping costs**, and schedule **carrier pickups** — all in one seamless flow.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
Shippers (individuals & SMB sellers) often struggle to measure and calculate **volumetric weight**, leading to:  
- Unexpected shipping costs & surcharges  
- Rejected or delayed shipments  
- Time wasted on manual measurements  

**Target Users:** Casual shippers, SMB e-commerce sellers, marketplace vendors.  

---

## 💡 Solution
**One-liner:** *"Snap. Calculate. Ship."*  

Volutrack leverages **computer vision + calibration** to estimate package dimensions and volumetric weight, fetches carrier rate estimates, and enables pickup scheduling.

### 🔑 Key Features
- 📷 Live webcam feed or photo upload  
- 📏 Calibration with reference object  
- 🎯 Cursor-based marking of package edges  
- 📐 Instant dimension + volumetric weight calculation  
- 🚚 Carrier cost comparison & pickup scheduling  
- 💾 Save/export results for future use
